The characters are not really that absorbing, and I feel that the narrator has much more to say about the experience of kayaking or canoeing the Northwest Coast from Sitka to Oregon than the fiction format allows him to. The description of the sea and land is really amazing and makes it absolutely worth reading. However, I have a bit of sympathy for the reviewer who said it was boring because the plot is not as gripping as a summary would suggest (4 men escape from Novo-Arkhangelsk, now Sitka, in order to eventually return to Sweden). It is a man against nature story, but I suppose I found the nature part much more interesting than the men.A non-fiction reflection retracing this journey interwoven with the author''s own thoughts probably would have been much more gripping.Still, it is worth reading nonetheless.');

For those of you looking for it, yes, this has the original Australian audio. It also happensto have the English dubbed version, just so you can remember what it was like being little and watching this on TV for the first time. Plenty ofextras and great quality, this made for an excellent ''guys night''.One thing I never really figured out about these movies... Mad Max doesn''t really seem especially... mad. I mean, he''s mad, but I always thoughtmad was supposed to mean crazy. He''s not all that crazy. Makes for great alliteration though.');

Then-- ONE DAY -- it hits you, the genius behind the songs, the hidden melodies, the amazing musicianship?That was my experience with this album. It took 2 years of (very) sporadic listenings to suddenly be hit in the head with just how flat-out AMAZING this album is. A few songs are easy and accessible (ie. "Captain Easychord"), while others may take a few listens to *really* appreciate--- but it''s worth the effort. (as a comparison, I found "Margerine Eclipse" very easy to get-into, while it took a while for "Dots and Loops" and "Cobra and Phases" to really sink-in).Very highly recommended, once it hits you, it will stay with you and grow-stronger with repeat-listens.');
